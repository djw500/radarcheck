# Product Guidelines

## Design Principles
- **Technical Precision:** Use industry-standard meteorological terminology (e.g., "Reflectivity," "12Z Run," "Dew Point"). Do not oversimplify.
- **Data Density:** Maximize information per screen pixel. Users want raw data, not whitespace.
- **Speed:** The interface must load instantly. Prioritize text and lightweight tables over heavy graphics.

## Tone & Voice
- **Professional:** Objective, concise, and fact-based.
- **Direct:** Avoid fluff. Present the numbers and the model metadata clearly.

## Visual Identity
- **Functional:** High contrast, clear tabular layouts, distinct color coding for weather thresholds (e.g., blue for rain, pink for mixed, white for snow).
- **Mobile-First:** Tables must remain readable and navigable on small screens.
